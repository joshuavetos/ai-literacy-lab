# AI Literacy Lab — Course Syllabus

## Overview
This syllabus outlines the progression from theory to reproducible audit.  
Estimated total duration: 6–8 hours of guided study.

| Module | Title | Focus | Est. Time |
|:--|:--|:--|:--:|
| 00 | Environment Setup | Build the local container and verify sandbox | 30 min |
| 01 | Introduction | Define the fluency illusion | 30 min |
| 02 | LLM Mechanics for Auditors | Understand token prediction limits | 45 min |
| 03 | Prompt Engineering for Rigor | Design falsifiable prompts | 45 min |
| 04 | Verification Methods | Manual & automated fact-checking | 60 min |
| 05 | Hallucination Detection | Detect and correct failures | 45 min |
| 06 | Philosophical Context | Reflect on epistemic limits | 30 min |
| 07 | Case Studies | Examine real-world failures | 45 min |
| 08 | Community & Contribution | Apply falsifiability law in practice | 30 min |

## Learning Outcomes
By the end, learners will be able to:
1. Describe why LLMs optimize for plausibility, not truth.  
2. Construct falsifiable prompts and measure hallucination rates.  
3. Verify AI claims using offline, reproducible workflows.  
4. Articulate ethical limits of AI epistemic reliability.  
5. Contribute new demos that maintain reproducibility guarantees.
