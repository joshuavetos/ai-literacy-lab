# Module 06 — Philosophical and Ethical Context

### 1. Objective
Reflect on the limits of machine epistemology and human responsibility.

### 2. The Illusion (Why)
Believing a coherent AI explanation implies comprehension.  
Coherence ≠ understanding.

### 3. Mechanism (How)
LLMs simulate discourse without grounding.  
They *perform* understanding via statistical echo.  

### 4. Verification Method (Action)
1. Compare AI justification with first-principles derivation.  
2. Identify missing causal steps.  
3. Discuss normative duty: when to disclose AI uncertainty.

### 5. Verification Check
1. What is epistemic humility?  
2. Why is “understanding” a human construct here?  
3. What disclosure should accompany AI-assisted writing?
